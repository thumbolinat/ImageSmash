# Group-Project- ImageSmash

# Purpose
A fun application which allows user to generate an image and a quote based on user input search criteria.
The application prompts user to input word or a phrase in search box. Upon hitting a submit button, the request is sent to 2 separate APIâ€™s. One API is an  image generator and another is a quote generator. The returned results are displayed together on a card element.
We were motivated to develop this app for the pure fun.  It has been stressful couple of years with pandemic so a little bit of fun and laughter could help lighten the load.
As a user I want to be able pull quotes and images and display them together to create off the wall funny messages.
